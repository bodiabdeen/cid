                <div class="detail-content">
                    Dr. Yamamoto was a brilliant molecular biologist who pioneered several breakthrough gene therapies that made NGT a leader in the industry. Known for his meticulous ethical standards and perfectionism. Married to Akiko Yamamoto for 28 years, two adult children living abroad. Reserved personality, few close friends, devoted to his work. Known to work late nights alone in his private lab.

                <div class="detail-content">
                    In the weeks before his death, Dr. Yamamoto became increasingly withdrawn and appeared stressed. Multiple witnesses reported heated arguments with executives. He had scheduled a confidential meeting with the Ethics Committee for November 25, 2084. <span class="classified">CLASSIFIED INTEL:</span> Forensic analysis of his personal workstation revealed he was compiling evidence of unauthorized human trials involving unapproved gene modifications.

                    Followed a strict routine. Took personalized gene therapy supplements daily at 22:30 JST (prepared by NGT's Medical Division). Vegetarian. Non-smoker. Exercised regularly. Security records show he typically left the building between 23:00-23:30 JST on weeknights. Trusted very few people with access to his private laboratory.

                        Harvard MBA, former investment banker at Goldman Sachs. Joined NGT in 2079 to "clean up" their financial operations. Reputation as a ruthless cost-cutter. Married to Sophia Chen (fashion designer), two children in private school. Known for prioritizing profits over research ethics. Multiple complaints filed against him for pressuring scientists to rush clinical trials.

                        Dr. Yamamoto's planned ethics disclosure would have destroyed NGT's upcoming IPO (valued at ¥45 billion). Financial records show Chen had ¥12 million in stock options that would vest upon successful IPO. Additionally, Chen had authorized the questionable trials that Yamamoto was investigating. Criminal exposure possible if evidence went public. Email exchanges show Chen threatening to "find a solution" to "the Yamamoto problem."

No scientific training in genetics, but has financial resources to hire someone with expertise.
